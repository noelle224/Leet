problem name:- Hamming Distance
problem link:- https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/

description:- The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
              Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
              
solution:- 

class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int b=1;
		int c=0;
		for(int i=0;i<=31;i++)
		{
			if((x&b) != (y&b))
			{
				c++;
			}
			b=b<<1;
		}
        return c;
        
    }
}
