description:- Influenced by Social Networking sites, Rahul launches his own site Friendsbook.
              Each user in Friendsbook is given a unique number, first user being numbered 1. 
              There are N users in Friendsbook numbered from 1 to N. In Friendsbook, i th user can make j th user his friend without becoming his friend himself, i.e. in Friendsbook, there is a one-way link rather than a two-way link as in Facebook. Moreover i th user can make j th user his friend iff i>j. Also one user should have no more and no less than one friend except user 1 who will have no friend. 
              Rahul wants to modify Friendsbook and find out whether one user is somehow linked to some other user. Help Rahul do so.
              
solution:-


public class Practice {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner in=new Scanner(System.in);
		int t=in.nextInt();
		while(t-->0)
		{
			int n=in.nextInt();
			//int arr[]=new int[n+1];
			int mat[][]=new int[n+1][n+1];
			for(int i=2;i<=n;i++)
			{
				int a=in.nextInt();
				mat[i][a]=1;
			}
			for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
			{
				for(int j=1;j<=n;j++)
				{
					if(i!=j && mat[i][j]==0)
					{
						mat[i][j]=(int)1e7;
					}
				}
			}
			
				
			for(int k=1;k<=n;k++)
			{
				for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
				{
					for(int j=1;j<=n;j++)
					{
						if(mat[i][k]+mat[k][j]<mat[i][j] && i!=j)
						{
							mat[i][j]=mat[i][k]+mat[k][j];
							//System.out.println("hi");
						}
					}
				}
			}
			
			for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
			{
				for(int j=1;j<i;j++)
				{
					if(mat[i][j]!=0 && mat[i][j]!=(int)1e7)
					{
						System.out.print(i+" "+j+" "+mat[i][j]+" ");
						
					}
				}
			
			}
			System.out.println();
		}
		

	}
