problem name:- Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation
problem link:- https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-number-of-set-bits-in-binary-representation/
description:-  Given two integers L and R, find the count of numbers in the range [L, R] (inclusive) having a prime number of set bits
               in their binary representation.
              (Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of 1s present when written in binary. For example, 21 written in binary is 10101 which has 3 set bits. Also, 1 is not a prime.)
 solution:-
 
 class Solution {
    static boolean isprime(int c)
	{
		if(c==1)
		{
			return false;
		}
		for(int i=2;i<=Math.sqrt(c);i++)
		{
			if(c%i==0)
				return false;
		}
		return true;
	}
    public int countPrimeSetBits(int L, int R) {
        int count=0;
		while(L<=R)
		{
			int k=1;
			int c=0;
			for(int i=0;i<=30;i++)
			{
				if((L&k)>0)
				{
					c++;
					
				}
				k=k<<1;
			}
			//System.out.println(c);
			if(isprime(c)==true)
			{
				count++;
			}
			L++;
		}
	   return count;
        
    }
}
